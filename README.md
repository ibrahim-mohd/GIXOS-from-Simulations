# Grazing Incidence X-ray Off-specular Scattering (GIXOS) from all-atom molecular dynamics simulations

The notebook provided here calculates the GIXOS profile from simulation for lipid monolayer systems to enable direct model-free comparison of experiments and 
simulations. The example directory contains an example electron density profile from MD simulations and the experimental GIXOS profile for the POPC-MC3 system is provided.
