# Grazing Incidence X-ray Off-specular Scattering (GIXOS) from all-atom molecular dynamics simulations

The notebook provided here calculates GIXOS profile from simulation for lipid monolayer systems to enable direct model-free comparison of experiments and 
simulations. The example directory an electron density profile from MD simulations for POPC-MC3 system is provided. The experimental GIXOS curves on the same systems
is also provided.
